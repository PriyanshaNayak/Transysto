# Transysto

# To be continued

# Inspiration :

Because we live in a heavily digitalized world, boosting traffic and trasanction is inherently linked to translating your content into a different language and letting it speak to everyone's needs and wants. This can be easily achieved through content translation.Choosing the right Translation service provider can result in your transaltion penetrating wider markets. Although Google tranlation helps, but it does not provide translation output in a SINGLE language understood by everyone. Therfore, our team has come up with "TRANSYSTO" breaking away the ice of confusion of languages.

# What it does :

Transysto is a widget that is literally for the people as well as by the people.It is a user-friendly platform where you can your put your statement or query in English and it gives the output in Odia as well as Hindi just like Google translator. But, the catch here is that it displays the sentence in English itself therefore being understandable and readable by everyone irrespective of their native language. The bottom line is that, High-quality and accurate trilingual language conversions are the keys for success for brands seeking out to branch out and speak nationally. 

# Advantages :
Transysto provides a critical cultural and economic bridge between people from different regions with Odisha. Some of the more obvious use-cases include :
1. Business - inter-regional trade, investment, contracts, finance.
2. Commerce - Travel, customer support, purchase of Odisha's indigenious products and goods.
3. Media - accessing information via search, sharing information via social netwroks, localization of content and advertising
4. Education - sharing of ideas, collaboration, transaltion of research papers.

To meet these needs, translation applications from Google and Microsoft can translate over 100 different languages but none of them provide the output in a "single" globally understood language, which Transysto will be able to do using the Neural machine model. 
Above everything else, the best feature of our website is that it can be accessed by everyone, from a kid to old, rich to poor, a person sitting at home to a working-class official.

# How we built it :
The transaltor website we have built is fitted with a Neural Machine model where we take inputs as Odia in English ASCII characters while giving the output in English and vice-versa. Our website is made up of Python , google collab (for writing code) using Html, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end designing part. We have used Machine Learning model for backend dataset. We have an input and output section for the language transaltion. 

# Challenges we ran into :
It was the first time we tried to make a full-fledged ML working model. We usually made only static websites, but making a dynamic back-end including website was both a little intimidating and challenging for us. The main problem was the large size of dataset required to implement the ML model which we had to add manually. We tried hard to replicate the translation of more languages, but due to lack of time and experience, we weren't able to sum up our ideas into our project.

# Accomplishments we are proud of :
We are glad we could overcome all the challenges and implement all our ideas, but most importantly , we could make something for the social good, for the community, with most of our capability within a short period of time.

# What's next for Transysto :
We are planning to add more regional languages like so that it can be put to real-time use, as we believe the world needs effective MULTILINGUAL SEM strategies which will benefit lots of different kinds of people.
